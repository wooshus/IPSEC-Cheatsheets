## 🎯 What is Pretexting?

Pretexting is the practice of creating a fabricated scenario (pretext) to engage a target and extract information or manipulate them into performing an action. It's the foundation of most social engineering attacks.

**Key Components:**
- 🎭 **Persona** - The fake identity you assume
- 📖 **Story** - The believable scenario/reason
- 🎯 **Goal** - What you want to achieve
- 🔧 **Props** - Supporting materials (badges, emails)

## 🧠 Psychological Principles

### Authority
```
✓ Use titles: "IT Director", "Security Manager"
✓ Dress the part: suits, uniforms, badges
✓ Speak confidently
✓ Reference policies and procedures
```

### Urgency
```
✓ "This needs to happen before the CEO's meeting at 3"
✓ "The system will lock you out in 10 minutes"
✓ "We're under audit and need this immediately"
✓ Create time pressure to prevent verification
```

### Reciprocity
```
✓ Do a small favor first
✓ "I just helped resolve that printer issue..."
✓ "I brought coffee for everyone..."
✓ Create obligation to return the favor
```

### Social Proof
```
✓ "Everyone else has already done this"
✓ "Your manager John already approved this"
✓ "The whole marketing team completed the form"
✓ Reference others who complied
```

### Liking
```
✓ Find common ground
✓ Mirror body language
✓ Compliment authentically
✓ Build rapport before asking
```
